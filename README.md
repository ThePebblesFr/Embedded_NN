# Commands to execute

* We advise you to create a virtual environment to work on the project. To do this, create an environment at the root of the project with the following commands: 

python -m venv envML *your version of python should be < 3.10, so take care to compile this line with the proper version*

*if your are on Windows*

envML/Scripts/Activate.ps1      <!-- allows to use the virtual python working environment -->

*otherwise*

source envML/bin/activate

deactivate                  <!-- disable the environment -->

*if you have a policy issue with powershell or windows*

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "Unrestricted" <!-- to disable the restrictions -->

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" <!-- to enable the restrictions -->


## Install the necessary packages in your own virtual environment (this can also works on your defaut environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt *or* python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### in .gitignore, the python virtual environment is ignored
<!-- it allows you to use the python working environment with all necessary packages only on your computer -->
