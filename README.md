# Commands to execute

## We advise you to create a virtual environment to work on the project. To do this, create an environment at the root of the project with the following commands: 

python -m venv envML
<!-- if your are on Windows -->
envML/Scripts/activate      <!-- allows to use the virtual python working environment -->
<!-- otherwise -->
source envML/bin/activate

deactivate                  <!-- disable the environment >

## install the necessary packages in your own virtual environment (this can also works on your defaut environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt <!--or--> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## to use our python virtual environment, it is in .gitignore
<!-- it allows you to use our python working environment with all necessary packages -->
