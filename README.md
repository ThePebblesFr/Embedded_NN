# Commands to execute

## We advise you to create a virtual environment to work on the project. To do this, create an environment at the root of the project with the following commands: 

python -m venv envML
<!-- if your are on Windows -->
envML/Scripts/activate      <!-- allows to use the virtual python working environment -->
<!-- otherwise -->
source envML/bin/activate

deactivate                  <!-- disable the environment >

<!-- if you have a policy issue with powershell or windows-->
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "Unrestricted" <!-- to disable the restrictions -->

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned" <!-- to enable the restrictions -->


## install the necessary packages in your own virtual environment (this can also works on your defaut environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt <!--or--> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## in .gitignore, the python virtual environment is ignored
<!-- it allows you to use the python working environment with all necessary packages only on your computer -->
